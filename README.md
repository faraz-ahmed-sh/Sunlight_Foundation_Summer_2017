# Analyzing crowdlaw, an online collaborative policy making, as a tool for community engagement


We have analyzed the key takeaways from public participation on crowdlaw, an online collaborative policy making tool between the residents and the government. The takeaways are meant to equip cities that are publishing their draft open data policies for public comment with knowledge and tools to address any popular questions, concern, feedback, or suggestions. 

The .ipynb file contains crowdlaw analyses with respect to total number of comments for each city, popular quoted-text policy sections, sentiment analysis of comments, and comment authors' backgrounds, besides a few other things.
